Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing this letter to recommend Lijie Tang for the position of Senior Software Engineer. He could be a highly reliable member of our company. 

Lijie is very passionate about programming and he is good at problem-solving. When he started his Computer Science program at Virginia Tech, he first took the class of Java compiler optimization. It is a hard class that you cannot finish without grit. He kept asking me questions at that time and his thinking process was intuitive and I was very impressed. 

After graduation, Lijie joined a small company and worked as a full-stack developer. His job was to develop a multi-user platform for online trading. I was asked by him about how to develop a user platform and suggested he choosing between NodeJS and Java Spring for this task and he, in the end, delivered two platforms from scratch in each language. 

I believe Lijie is a highly reliable and capable person at work and I highly recommend our company to take him in.

Regards,
